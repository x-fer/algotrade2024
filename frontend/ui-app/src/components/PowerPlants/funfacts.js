This process involves collecting the methane gas emitted from decomposing cow dung in anaerobic digesters and then using it to power generators. It's not only a creative way to address waste management from farms but also showcases how renewable energy can be sourced from unexpected placesâ€”literally turning cow patties into power!"})
